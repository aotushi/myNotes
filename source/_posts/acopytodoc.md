Data breaches that compromise personal accounts have become a frequent occurrence. I was an involuntary participant in such an event in October 2013 when Adobe got hacked. Despite the fact that Adobe stored the passwords encrypted, there is no guarantee that the hackers were not able to retrieve the plain text passwords. With specialized computers a brute force attach can crack an eight character password within a few hours. And that assumes the password is random gibberish and not among the most commonly used passwords. As passwords are often reused, a cracked password opens the doors for the hackers to try to access other accounts as well.
